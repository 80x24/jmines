        <h1>Game Rules</h1>
        <p>The goal of jmines is to clear the board without detonating any
            of the mines in the fastest amount of time. The clock to the right
            indicates the time it takes you to clear the board.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The game begins with a board of covered tiles. Click on any tile
                to uncover it. This will reveal one of the following items:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>A number</b> which represents the number of mines in
                        the adjacent tiles. These numbers help you deduce where the mines are
                        so that you can mark them with a flag. Right click to mark a tile with a flag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>A blank tile</b>, which means there are no mines under any of
                        the adjacent tiles.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>A mine</b>, which will detonate and cause you to lose.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Repeat the previous step until you have uncovered all of the tiles
                which do not have mines underneath them.
            </li>
        </ol>

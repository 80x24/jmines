OG Minesweeper

- Looks to be 160x200 total pixels.
- squares are 16x16 
- New mines is 600x460
  That's fine for desktop but probably too big for mobile.
- No sound. Because why would we need that?

Reveal of squares: A click will reveal all of the squares that do not
have a number associated with them, and then revel all of the squares
that are adjacent to the non-numbered squares.

- 32x32px squares.
- unclicked square: #babdb6
- clicked: #deddedc
- background: #f2f1f0
- text: #2e3436

- There is an animation for mouse button down. I'm probably not going to
implement that. I'm also not implementing ? blocks.
